echo A server needs a small log file or disk partition, preferrably on a
echo disk by itself. It also needs a metadata file or partition of approx
echo 4% of your filespace.
echo 
echo Raw partitions have advantages because we can write to the disk
echo faster, but we have to load a copy of the complete RVM data
echo partition into memory. With files we can use a private mmap, which
echo reduces memory pressure and speeds up server startup by several
echo orders of magnitude.
echo
echo Servers with a smaller dataset but heavy write activity will
echo probably benefit from partitions. Mostly read-only servers with a
echo large dataset will definitely benefit from an RVM data file. Nobody
echo has really measured where the breakeven point is, so I cannot
echo really give any hard numbers.
