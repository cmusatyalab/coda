# Coda File System Documentation

!!! warning

    Some information in the documentation presented here is outdated.  We try
    to leave notes like this one in places where we are aware the information
    is somewhat, or severely, outdated.

The following will be your primary resources for getting up and running:

- [Coda File System User and System Administrator Manual](manual/index.md)
- _Manual Pages_ - Documenting Coda's commands and file formats, see left
  navigation menu.

## Additional Documentation

- [CodaFS Python module](python/index.md) - Python wrappers and scripts that
  are mostly optional but can be helpful for users and administrators.
- [Scientific papers from the Coda project][coda-papers]
  :octicons-link-external-16: - The original design and studies that were done.

## Legacy Documentation

!!! info

    The left navigation menu has various links to older documents under the
    `Legacy Documentation` entry.  Their information has not been integrated
    back into the *Coda File System User and System Administrator Manual* so
    there may very well be relevant information there.
