 *
 *  Fold performs case-folding, moving string "in" to
 *  "out" and folding one case to another en route.
 *  Folding may be upper-to-lower case (folddown) or
 *  lower-to-upper case.
 *  Foldup folds to upper case; folddown folds to lower case.
 *  The same string may be specified as both "in" and "out".
 *  The address of "out" is returned for convenience.
