.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I
Getoct
and
.I
gethex
ask the user to type in an unsigned octal or hexadecimal integer.
.sp
They begin by printing the string
.I
prompt
as a message to the user.
The user then types in a number of
the appropriate form.
If the number is valid and is
within the range
.I
min
to
.I
max,
then it is returned as the value of
.I
getoct
or
.I
gethex.
If it is invalid or is out of range, then an error message is
printed and the prompt-and-response cycle is repeated.
If the user types just a carriage return, then the value
.I
defalt
is assumed.
.sp
.I
Getoct
and
.I
gethex
are identical, except in the manner in which the user's
input is converted into an unsigned integer.
.sp
.I
Getoct
converts the input by assuming it represents a
string of octal digits.
Leading blanks and tabs are ignored; conversion
stops at the first character which is not a legal
octal digit.
No signs (+ or \-) are allowed.
.sp
.I
Gethex
converts the input by assuming it represents a
string of hexadecimal digits.
There may be leading
blanks and tabs; in addition, the digit string may be
preceded by "0x" or "0X", which will be ignored.
The valid characters include "0" through "9", "a" through "f",
and "A" through "F".
Conversion stops at the first character
which is not a legal hexadecimal digit.
No signs (+ or \-) are
allowed.
