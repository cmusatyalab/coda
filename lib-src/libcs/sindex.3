Avoid using this routine.   Use strstr(3) it is ANSI, smaller, faster,
the same parameters and it is  much much more portable.
.SH "LIBRARY NOTES"
You must link against /usr/local/lib/libcs.a to define this routine.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IR index (3)
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"

.SH "BUGS"
If
.I
small
is the null string, 0 is always returned.
