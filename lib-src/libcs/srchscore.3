.SH "NAME"
srchscore \- determine quality of string match
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B
int srchscore (big,small);
.br
.B
char *big,*small;
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I
Srchscore
takes two strings, and gives you back a number which tries to capture
the idea of "how well" they match each other.
The integer returned is
in the range from 0 to the square of the length of
.I
small,
with a higher
score indicating a better match.
.sp
The match is determined by taking consecutive substrings of
.I
small
which match substrings of
.I
big,
squaring the length of each such substring, then imposing a penalty
for not-quite-exactly-matching corresponding substrings.
These scores
are added up to determine the final score.
.SH "LIBRARY NOTES"
You must link against /usr/local/lib/libcs.a to define this rotine.
