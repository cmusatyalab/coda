/*  stablk  --  string table lookup
 * 
 *  Usage:  i = stablk (arg,table,quiet);
 * 
 * 	int i;
 * 	char *arg,**table;
 * 	int quiet;
 * 
 *  Stablk looks for a string in "table" which matches
 *  "arg".  Table is declared like this:
 *    char *table[] = {"string1","string2",...,0};
 *  Each string in the table is checked via stablk() to determine
 *  if its initial characters match arg.  If exactly one such
 *  string matches arg, then the index of that string is returned.
 *  If none match arg, or if several match, then -1 (respectively -2)
 *  is returned.  Also, for either of these errors, if quiet is
 *  FALSE, the user will be asked if he wants a list of the possible
 *  strings.  In the case of multiple matches, the matching strings
 *  will be marked specially.
