# Note: to build librvmlwp.a with debugging for the log tail bug,
# Use one of the two commented out targets instead.

# RVM can be built in 4 ways:
#  - cthreads
#               libs: must use libthreads.a and libmach.a

#  - no threads (used by standalone rvm utilities in Coda

#		libs: none

#  - lwp theads (used in Coda)
#		flags: -DRVM_USELWP
#		libs: 
#		library produced: librvmlwp.a
#  - pthreads
